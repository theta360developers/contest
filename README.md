# Unofficial Guide Contest webpage repository

This is a GitHub repository with webpages for the RICOH THETA Unofficial Guide contest help and tips information. The contest has some, um, tricky ins and outs. Like prize money being awarded in yen. So we built a site to show a countdown clock, translate deadline dates and times to US Pacific Time, help with signing up, explanations of categories, and lots more.
